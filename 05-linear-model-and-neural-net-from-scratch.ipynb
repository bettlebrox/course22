    "It's actually pretty cool that we've managed to create a real deep learning model from scratch and trained it to get over 80% accuracy on this task, all in the course of a single notebook!\n",

    "The biggest differences in practical models to what we have above are:\n",

    "- How initialisation and normalisation is done to ensure the model trains correctly every time\n",
